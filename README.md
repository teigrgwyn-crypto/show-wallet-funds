This project is a simple terra.js demo to show how one might get the total coins available on a wallet by entering it's Terra address.

It comes preloaded with a demo wallet and uses the testnet (bombay-12) for the purposes of the demonstration.

If you wish to see it in action, view the github-pages deployment on the 'deployment' section of this page.
